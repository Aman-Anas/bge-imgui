# bge-imgui
Integrate pyimgui with the Blender Game Engine (and variants)
Currently works with RanGE engine and upbge 0.2.5, theoretically works in upbge 0.3+ but my tests showed some bugs...

### Usage
To use in your game, simply add the bgimgui folder alongside your game blend. 
Not much documentation, but there are some comments in the python scripts
and a .range example file to help you.
